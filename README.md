# Recursiva

Inspired by Dennis Mitchell's Jelly (and other languages made by guys in codegolf.stackexchange), Recursiva is an esolang, based mainly on recursive-approaches (in the making). 

# How to run? 

#### <i>You need python 3 (3.5+ recommended) to run the interpreter. REPL might need few modifications for non-windows platform</i> 

  1. Just Fire `python RecursivaInterpreter.py` to start the REPL. 
  
  OR
  
  2. `python RecursivaInterpreter.py code.txt input.txt` to get recursiva code and get input from the files.
  
# Hello, World! in recursiva:
